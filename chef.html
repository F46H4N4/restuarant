        <p> is a trained professional cook and tradesman who is proficient in all aspects of food preparation, often
            focusing on a particular cuisine. The word "chef" is derived from the term chef de cuisine (French
            pronunciation: ​[ʃɛf.də.kɥi.zin]), the director or head of a kitchen. Chefs can receive formal training from
            an institution, as well as by apprenticing with an experienced chef.

            There are different terms that use the word chef in their titles, and deal with specific areas of food
            preparation. Examples include the sous-chef, who acts as the second-in-command in a kitchen, and the chef de
            partie, who handles a specific area of production</p>
